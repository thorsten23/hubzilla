# How to use Hubzilla to create paid apps (advanced topic)
The following section is not a step by step instruction but an idea how paid apps can be realized with Hubzilla.

Support for custom apps you or your administrator may choose to create includes fields such as "Price of app" and "Location for purchase"

The properties "Price" and "Location for purchase" are not applicable to core Hubzilla apps.
Zot-ID is appended to the URL ?zid=user@hub.localhost

Hubzilla does not control how you get apps or what you do with them or what they do.

We also do not control what apps you can run on our operating system or force you to buy/obtain your apps from a single source. You can build them, you can share them, and if you want to try and build a business or revenue stream, you can charge money for them.

How you accomplish getting compensated is not our concern, Hubzilla is not here to tell you what to do or how to do it. It's an operating system, not a corporation with a profit agenda. At the most basic level, let's say you've got a webapp and you want to sell it. Setup a paypal/patreon/donation/whatever page and collect your payment. Make sure people give you their Hubzilla ID when they pay. Once they've done so, you can add them to the ACL for a Hubzilla resource - and they can access it via magic-auth as long as they are logged into a compatible site somewhere, and even if they move to another site.

This is our answer to all the walled garden app-stores. It turns their whole business model on its head. You are in control. If you want to make money, you get all the money.

As shown in an earlier comment, you can share apps (using your network app). Anybody else can click it and install it and use it. If it's a paid app and you haven't paid anything, you might get a 404 or a 'sell page' if you click on it. Our apps run server-side so they can't snoop around in your personal files and crack your banking passwords and listen in to your bedroom chitchat.
