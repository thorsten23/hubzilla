# Permissions and permission roles

## Permission roles
When you create a channel we allow you to select different 'roles' for that channel. These create an entire family of permissions and privacy settings that are appropriate for that role. Typical roles are "Social - mostly public", "Social - mostly private", "Forum - public" and many others. These bring a level of simplicity to managing permissions. Just choose a role and appropriate permissions are automatically applied. You can also choose 'Custom/Expert mode' and change any individual permission setting in any way you desire.


Privacy and permission setting of an channel are made up by the following parts:

1. permission limits (like "can view my posts")
2. default permission settings for connections
3. visibility settings (chat, directory)
4. default privacy group
5. auto privacy group for new connections
6. automatic approval of connection request and apply of permissions

## Permissions
The following permissions will be set by your chosen channel permission category:

- Can view my channel stream and posts
- Can send me their channel stream and posts
- Can view my default channel profile
- Can view my connections
- Can view my file storage and photos
- Can upload/modify my file storage and photos
- Can view my channel webpages
- Can view my wiki pages
- Can create/edit my channel webpages
- Can write to my wiki pages
- Can post on my channel (wall) page
- Can comment on or like my posts
- Can send me private mail messages
- Can like/dislike profiles and profile things
- Can forward to all my channel connections via @+ mentions in posts
- Can chat with me
- Can source my public posts in derived channels
- Can administer my channel


## Permission Roles

- Social
  - Mostly Public

    The channel is a typical social networking profile. By default posts and published items are public, but one can over-ride this when creating the item and restrict it. You are listed in the directory. Your online presence and connections are visible to others.

  - Restricted

    By default all posts and published items are sent to your 'Friends' privacy group and not made public. New friends are added to this privacy group. You can over-ride this and create a public post or published item if you desire. You are listed in the directory. Your online presence (for chat) and your connections (friends) are visible to your profile viewers.

  - Private

    By default all posts and published items are sent to your 'Friends' privacy group. New friends are added to this privacy group. You can over-ride this and create a public post or public item if you desire. You are NOT listed in the directory. Only your connections can see your other connections. Your online presence is hidden.
- Forum
  - Mostly Public

    The channel is a typical forum. By default posts and published items are public. Members may post by @mention+ or wall-to-wall post. Posting photos and other published items is blocked. The channel is visible in the directory. Members are added automatically.
  - Restricted

    By default all posts and published items are sent to the channel's 'Friends' privacy group. New friends are added to this privacy group. Members may post by @mention+ or wall-to-wall post, but posts and replies may also be seen by other recipients of the top-level post who are not members. The channel is visible in the directory. Members must be manually added by the forum owner.

  - Private

    By default all posts and published items are sent to your 'Friends' privacy group. New friends are added to this privacy group. The owner can over-ride this and create a public post or public item if desired. Members cannot. You are NOT listed in the directory. Only your connections can see your other connections. Your online presence is hidden. Members must be manually added by the forum owner. Posting by @mention+ is disabled. Posts can only be made via wall-to-wall posts, and sent to members of the 'Friends' privacy group. They are not publicly visible.  
- Feed
  - Public

    Similar to Social - Mostly Public, but tailored for RSS feed sources. Items may be freely republished and sourced. Online presence is meaningless, therefore hidden. New connections are automatically approved.  
  - Restricted

    Not listed in directory. Online presence is meaningless, therefore hidden. Feed is published only to members of the 'Friends' privacy group. New connections are automatically added to this privacy group. Members must be manually approved by the channel owner.
- Special
  - Celebrity/Soapbox

    Listed in directory. Communications are by default public. Online presence is hidden. No commenting or feedback of any form is allowed, though connections have the ability to "like" your profile.
  - Group Repository

    A public forum which allows members to post files/photos/webpages.
- Custom/Expert Mode
-



## Expert Mode
If none of the above permission roles meets your expectations you can set all the privacy and permission manually to suit your specific needs.

**To use the custom/expert mode in your channel security and privacy settings your in your technical skill level must be at least at level four.**


- Public isn't available anymore ????

The following permissions are set or unset depending on the chosen permission role but can be changed in expert mode
- automatic confirmation of connectin requests (perms_auto)
- show/hide online status (online)
- publish in global directory (directory_publish)


Furthermore in expert mode you can
- change channel permission limits
- set a defaut acl
- add new connections to a chosen privacy group
- automatic confirmation of connectin requests (perms_auto)

##  Connection default permission
3. in expert mode the 'connection permissions' will be available on the side menu. It's probably important to review this as well as the limits and ACL settings because this determines what permissions are given to somebody you connect with and perhaps it should be located in the permission section with everything else that's related to permissions, but it isn't currently.


## Permission limits
There are a large number of individual permissions. These control everything from the ability to view your stream to the ability to chat with you. Every permission has a limit. The scope of these permissions varies from "Only me" to "Everybody on the internet" - though some scopes may not be available for some permissions. The limit applies to any published thing you create which has no privacy or access control. For example if you publish a photo and didn't select a specific audience with permission to view it, we apply the limit. These limits apply to everything within that permission rule, so you cannot apply a limit to one photo. The limit applies to all your photos. If all your photos are visible to everybody on the internet and you reduce the limit only to friends, all of your photos will now be visible only to friends.

Permission limits control "can this viewer see my wiki pages (at all)?".


Everything else is just a way to provide a 'set-and-forget' permission definition and be done with it; but still allow those with special circumstances to configure it in a completely different way.

. If you must use a custom mode to achieve your goals, start by selecting (and changing to) the closest available role first. Then change the setting to custom/expert and only modify the one or two things you feel you need to adjust for your situation.

A permission role consists of:

1. permission limits (like "can view my posts")
2. default permission settings for connections
3. visibility settings (chat, directory)
4. default privacy group
5. auto privacy group for new connections
6. automatic approval of connection request and apply of permissions

There are several permission roles predefined. 3 to 5 are only editable in the custom/expert role. For all other predefined roles settings 3 to 5 cannot be changed.

## Choosing a permission prole
It's easy to imagine how all this flexibility and freedom to assign detailed permissions can be confusing or overwhelming to people unaccustomed to thinking about such things. To help make things simpler, Hubzilla offers a set of permission roles you can choose for your channel. Depending on what your channel represents and how you plan to use it, you will have drastically different expectations about privacy and the kinds of permissions it will be granting to other channels. If your channel represents your personal self and you plan to primarily use the channel to interact with your close friends and family, you will expect that posts and photos and other shared things will be private, visible only to your loved ones. On the other hand, if your channel represents your advocacy group and you want to host a blog and a public website, then you will expect that most things should be visible to the public internet.

You can choose from one of the available permission roles, where the general categories include:

    Social networking
    Community forum
    Feed republish
    Special purpose

Each one of these categories has one or more roles to choose from. Most people will choose a Social Networking role if their channel represents their personal self. Those more interested in something like a public micro-blogging experience might select the "Mostly Public" or "Party" Social Networking role. Those desiring more privacy by default might choose the "Restricted" or "Private" role. Another common channel type is for use as a forum, and in this case the natural choice will be one of the Forum roles.


## Recommendations
Some permission roles create a default ACL which includes the 'Friends' privacy group and all new connections are added to this group.

There is a reason for this: to make a post public you don't have to mess with custom permissions and limits, you simply change the ACL and untick the Friends group. If you change the permission limit to accomplish this you've also changed the visibility of any existing posts/items which have no ACL. This could be a dangerous decision. For this reason all of the predefined roles default all 'read' permissions to public and control access completely with ACLs.

Many newcomers trying to use 'expert' permissions didn't get this concept and immediately set their 'can view my channel stream and posts' permission to something restrictive. What they didn't understand is that if they decide later to make something public they have to change the limit, and in so doing they make ALL their previous posts public, because they didn't have any ACL set. This is why we strongly recommend people use the predefined roles and leave the expert permissions for experts.

Hubzilla permissions and privacy for dummies:

Choose 'social - mostly public' if you are offered a choice. In 2.5 and later, your first channel will be created with 'social - mostly public' unless your site administrator is a sadist and chooses something different for you.

Don't federate with other networks.

If you want to restrict something, look for a lock icon. Restrict it as desired.

Have a #homebrew.

If you want either more or less privacy, you have complete control of the entire permission system. Really. Total control. There are consequences and trade-offs going either direction. We strongly recommend that you keep a "normal" channel for when you get tired of dealing with the consequences and tradeoffs, and create a separate one for your special privacy needs.

We highly recommend that you use the "typical social network" settings when you create your first channel, as it allows others to communicate with you and help you out if you have difficulty. You will find that these settings allow you as much privacy as you desire - when you desire it; but also allow you to communicate in public if you choose to. You are free to use much more private settings once you have learned your way around.
