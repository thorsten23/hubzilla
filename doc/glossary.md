###### channel
The fundamental identity on the grid. Channels can make connections with other channels to share information with highly detailed permissions.

###### clone
Channels can have clones associated with separate and otherwise unrelated accounts on independent hubs. Communications shared with a channel are synchronized among the channel clones, allowing a channel to send and receive messages and access shared content from multiple hubs. Cloning allows you to completely move a channel from one hub to another, taking your data and connections with you. See nomadic identity.

###### directory service

###### grid
The global network of hubs that exchange information with each other using the Zot protocol.

###### hub
An instance of Hubzilla running on a standard web server which is connected to the grid. Hubs are provided by a **hub administrator** and may be public or private, paid or free.

###### hub administrator
The system operator of an individual hub.

###### Hubzilla
**TO BE CHECKED**
Otherwise referred to as "the network", Hubzilla is a collection of individual computers/servers (aka **hubs**) which connect together to form a larger cooperative network.

###### nomadic identity
The ability to authenticate and easily migrate an identity across independent hubs and web domains. Nomadic identity provides true ownership of an online identity, because the identities of the channels controlled by an account on a hub are not tied to the hub itself. A hub is more like a "host" for channels. With Hubzilla, you don't have an "account" on a server like you do on typical websites; you own an identity that you can take with you across the grid by using clones.

###### Primary channel
The primary channel is your "preferred location". Best to provide an example here. Let's say I don't have a channel clone, but I do routine backups to a thumb drive. This thumb drive contains my identity and friends, but *not* all of my content. If my site goes down "temporarily" I can use this thumb drive and load it on another site and stay connected with my friends, but I still want my "home URL" to point to the site with all my content, not the new site which has none. Your primary URL is the one that people will visit if they click your photo or name.

###### Technical skill level
Account setting where you can adjust your user experience depending on your technical knowledge. See [Registration](./member/registration.md).

###### Term of services

###### Zot
The novel JSON-based protocol for implementing secure decentralised communications and services. It differs from many other communication protocols by building communications on top of a decentralised identity and authentication framework. The authentication component is similar to OpenID conceptually but is insulated from DNS-based identities. Where possible remote authentication is silent and invisible. This provides a mechanism for internet-scale distributed access control which is unobtrusive.
