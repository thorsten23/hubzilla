Tech levels (or technical skill levels) are used to provide you a experience corresponding to your technical knowledge. By selecting a technical skill level the number of available options and possibilities are limited so you don't become overwhelmed in Hubzilla. If you get more experienced over time you can change your tech level.

If the tech levels are not visible to you you have to ask your hub administrator to unlock them.

There are six different tech levels available:

| Level | Description |
| :-: | :- |
| 0 | Beginner/Basic |
| 1 | Novice - not skilled but willing to learn |
| 2 | Intermediate - somewhat comfortable |
| 3 | Advanced - very comfortable |
| 4 | Expert - I can write computer code |
| 5 | Wizard - I probably know more than you do |

Depending on your adjusted tech level more and more features become unlocked.
