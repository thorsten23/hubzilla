## Permission categories
If you have a common set of permissions you always want to use for your connections you can activate the additional function "permission groups". You can define several permission groups by your own and apply them to each of your connection. You can also set a default permission group which is applied to your connections by default.

## Permission groups
Permission groups is an additonal feature
- define new group and set individual permissions for this group
- permissions from the privacy settings cannot be overwritten

- when I'm in expert mode I can add new connections to a privacy group
what is the difference to the default permission group?

For instance permission groups will be required for issue tracking. Some viewers will be issue creators, some will be public viewers, and some will be developers. Permission groups also lets us create different structures like "friends vs. followers".
