## Expert Mode
If none of the above permission roles meets your expectations you can set all the privacy and permission manually to suit your specific needs.

**To use the custom/expert mode in your channel security and privacy settings your in your technical skill level must be at least at level four.**


- Public isn't available anymore ????

The following permissions are set or unset depending on the chosen permission role but can be changed in expert mode
- automatic confirmation of connectin requests (perms_auto)
- show/hide online status (online)
- publish in global directory (directory_publish)


Furthermore in expert mode you can
- change channel permission limits
- set a defaut acl
- add new connections to a chosen privacy group
- automatic confirmation of connectin requests (perms_auto)

##  Connection default permission
3. in expert mode the 'connection permissions' will be available on the side menu. It's probably important to review this as well as the limits and ACL settings because this determines what permissions are given to somebody you connect with and perhaps it should be located in the permission section with everything else that's related to permissions, but it isn't currently.


## Permission limits
There are a large number of individual permissions. These control everything from the ability to view your stream to the ability to chat with you. Every permission has a limit. The scope of these permissions varies from "Only me" to "Everybody on the internet" - though some scopes may not be available for some permissions. The limit applies to any published thing you create which has no privacy or access control. For example if you publish a photo and didn't select a specific audience with permission to view it, we apply the limit. These limits apply to everything within that permission rule, so you cannot apply a limit to one photo. The limit applies to all your photos. If all your photos are visible to everybody on the internet and you reduce the limit only to friends, all of your photos will now be visible only to friends.

Permission limits control "can this viewer see my wiki pages (at all)?".

ACLs control "can this viewer see this wiki page".

Everything else is just a way to provide a 'set-and-forget' permission definition and be done with it; but still allow those with special circumstances to configure it in a completely different way.

. If you must use a custom mode to achieve your goals, start by selecting (and changing to) the closest available role first. Then change the setting to custom/expert and only modify the one or two things you feel you need to adjust for your situation.


## Permission groups
Permission groups is an additonal feature
- define new group and set individual permissions for this group
- permissions from the privacy settings cannot be overwritten

- when I'm in expert mode I can add new connections to a privacy group
what is the difference to the default permission group?

For instance permission groups will be required for issue tracking. Some viewers will be issue creators, some will be public viewers, and some will be developers. Permission groups also lets us create different structures like "friends vs. followers".
