# Accounts

In order to use Hubzilla you have to register an account on a Hubzilla server. Some servers are open for registration, some are closed and at some servers you need an invitation to register. For the last one you need an invitation code which comes to you by mail.


## Where to create an account
From a technical point of view it doesn't matter where you create your account. All hubs are connected with each other (except totally isolated hubs). So if you register on one hub you are able to connect to channels and sites on other hubs.

Not all hubs are open for registration. Some are closed and for some you need an invitation. For some hubs there also may be a paid membership.
Read the term of service of the hub on which you want to create your account.

What you should consider when creating an account on a hub:

**Censorship:**
Server and hub administrators are subject to local laws and MAY remove  objectionable content from their site/hub.

**Privacy Policy**
Private channel content CAN be seen in the database of every involved hub administrator, but private messages are obscured in the database. The latter means that it is very difficult, but NOT impossible for this content to be seen by a hub administrator.

You can get more information about censorship and privacy at [Privacy Polivy](./about/privacy.md),

## How to create an account

To get to the registration site you simply press the corresponding button or directly call the URL of the site you want to register to followed by "/register".

Starting at the registry page you have to enter a valid email-address and choose a password. To ensure you didn't made a typing error you have to repeat your password. The password has to be at least six characters long.

If an invitation was required to register at this hub you also have to enter your invitation code.

To finalize your registration you have to read and accept the terms of service and to confirm that you are at least 13 years old.

Just hit the "register"-button. Ready.

### Why do you need my e-mail-address?
Your e-mail-address is required to activate your account. This is not necessary at all hubs but should be their default setting.

Furthermore your e-mail-address can be used to receive notification about different events like somebody mentions you in his post. But this is optional and can be deactivated if you don't want to receive any notifications by e-mail-address.

The most important however is that you e-mail needed to recover your password when you lose it.

Your e-mail-address itself will never be published on Hubzilla and only be used for purpose described above.

### What's next?
As already told the e-mail-address you specified during the registration process will be validated. Therefore your Hubzilla-server will send you a registration confirmation to this e-mail-address. This confirmation contains a link to validate your e-mail-address.

If you don't receive this registration confirmation have a look into your spam folder.

With this the registration is complete. If you click the link or copy the URL given to you in the registration confirmation into a browser, you can create a new channel.

To be able to use Hubzilla you have to create at least one channel.

Further reading about channels and channel creation can be found here:

## Account settings
Compared to the other options there is only a small number of settings for your account. Here you can change your e-mail-address, your password or change your tech level (described below).

Furthermore you can use set up a technical skill level to fit your user experience to you technical skills. When you are new to Hubzilla we recommend to start with tech level 0 'Beginner/Basic'. In this way most features are hidden so you can concentrate on the basic functionality. Once you've become familar with Hubzilla you can increase your tech level to get to know the more advanced feature.

Tech levels are explained in [Features](./features/tech_leveld.md)


## How to delete an account
To remove your account on a hub you simply go to the account settings and hit the "Remove Account" button or just visit the URL https://yoursite/removeaccount where you have to replace 'yoursite' with the domain name of your Hubzilla site.

Your account and all its channels will be completely removed from the network. This action is permanent and can not be undone! If you have identity clones on other sites this only removes the channel instance which exists on this site.

You will need to confirm your password and the channel you are currently logged into will be removed.

**This is irreversible.**
