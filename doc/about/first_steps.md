# Welcome to Hubzilla

Nice that you're here! When you are reading this help you either just registered an account on a Hubilla-Server (a so called 'hub' from now on) or you intend to do so and are now looking for further information.

After your first registration on a hub, Hubzilla can be very overwhelming at the beginning. There are so many features and settings that you don't know where to start or you even are be afraid to overlook something important.

With these little overview we want to take you by your hand and guide you through your first steps in Hubzilla.

## First steps

1. **Registration:** In order to use Hubzilla you must register on a hub of your choice and create an account. All you need for registration is a valid e-mail-address. A detailed description of the registration process can be found [here](../accounts.md).

2. **Channel creation:** Usually after creating an account and logging in for the first time you will be asked to create a new channel. A channel is the fundamental identity on the grid. Channels can be used as a blog, a forum or something else. But mostly a channel is used to represent you in the grid. So choose your name wisely. Channel creation is documented in [channels](member/guide/channels.md).

3. **Channel settings:** Once a channel is created, adjusting the channel settings is recommended. Choose your security and privacy and your notification settings.

4. **Profiles:** Ok. You've got your channel up and running. As your channel should represent 'you' in the grid we have to work on your profile. Load up a nice photo of yourself and edit your general interests as you like. **Important:** depending on your privacy settings your profile may be visible to the whole internet. Details about creating and editing profiles can be found  [here](../members/guide/profiles.md).

5. **User Interface:** How is the user interface organized? Where can I get to my settings, profiles? How do I see what is going on in the grid? [Here](../members/guide/user_interface.md) is a short overview over the Hubzilla user interface.

6. **Making connections:** Hubzilla without any connections is only half fun. How you can connect to other, use privacy groups and organize your connections is written [here](../members/guide/connections.md). Furthermore we have some recommendations with whom you should connect like the Hubzilla support forum.

7. **Your first post:** Of course you want to share messages, links, pictures and more with other. How you limit your posts to special connections, mention connections, use labels, format your text is described [here](../members/guide/posts.md).

## Where to go from here?
That was a lot of first steps and a lot of information. If you want to have a deeper understanding on how Hubzilla works, the meaning of nomadic identity and care about your privacy you should have a look at the [concepts](../concepts) and the [privacy policy](./privacy_policy.md)

If you have any problems or questions don't hesitate to post to Hubzilla support forum. There are a lot of nice people out there who are willing to help.
