# What is Hubzilla?

Hubzilla is a **free and open source** set of web applications and services running on a special kind of web server, called a "hub", that can connect to other hubs in a decentralized network we like to call "the grid", providing sophisticated communications, identity, and access control services which work together seamlessly across domains and independent websites. It allows anybody to publicly or privately publish content via "channels", which are the fundamental, cryptographically secured identities that provide authentication independently of the hubs which host them. This revolutionary liberation of online identity from individual servers and domains is called "nomadic identity", and it is powered by the Zot protocol, a new framework for decentralized access control with fine-grained, extensible permissions.

## Right ... what is Hubzilla?

From the practical perspective of hub members who use the software, Hubzilla offers a variety of familiar, integrated web apps and services, including:

- social networking discussion threads
- cloud file storage
- photo albums
- access control
- calendar and contacts (with CalDAV and CardDAV support)
- webpage building and hosting with a content management system
- wiki
- chatrooms
- and more...

While all of these apps and services can be found in other software packages, only Hubzilla allows you to set permissions for groups and individuals who may not even have accounts on your hub! In typical web apps, if you want to share things privately on the internet, the people you share with must have accounts on the server hosting your data; otherwise, there is no robust way for your server to authenticate visitors to the site to know whether to grant them access. Hubzilla solves this problem with an advanced system of remote authentication that validates the identity of visitors by employing techniques that include public key cryptography.
