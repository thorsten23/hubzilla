# About the project

## Who we are
The Hubzilla community consists of passionate volunteers creating an open source commons of decentralized services which are highly integrated and can rival the feature set of large centralized providers. We do our best to provide ethical software which places you in control of your online communications and privacy expectations.

## Contacts
The best possibility to get in contact to the developers or simply to get some kind of help in case of questions is to connect to the Hubzilla support forum. Don't hesitate to ask questions or make suggestions.

## Hubzilla Governance
Governance relates to the management of a project and particularly how this relates to conflict resolution.

Community Governance

The project is maintained and decisions made by the 'community'. The governance structure is still evolving. Until the structure is finalized, decisions are made in the following order:

1. Lazy Consensus

  If a project proposal is made to one of the community governance forums and there are no serious objections in a "reasonable" amount of time from date of proposal (we usually provide 2-3 days for all interested parties to weigh in), no vote needs to be taken and the proposal will be considered approved. Some concerns may be raised at this time, but if these are addressed during discussion and workarounds provided, it will still be considered approved.

2. Veto

    Senior developers with a significant history of project commits may veto any decision. The decision may not proceed until the veto is removed or an alternative proposal is presented.

3. Community Vote

    A decision which does not have a clear mandate or clear consensus, but is not vetoed, can be taken to a community vote. At present this is a simple popular vote in one of the applicable community forums.  At this time, popular vote decides the outcome. This may change in the future if the community adopts a 'council' governance model. This document will be updated at that time with the updated governance rules.

Community Voting does not always provide a pleasant outcome and can generate polarized factions in the community (hence the reason why other models are under consideration). If the proposal is 'down voted' there are still several things which can be done and the proposal re-submitted with slightly different parameters (convert to an add-on, convert to an optional feature which is disabled by default, etc.). If interest in the feature is high and the vote is "close", it can generate lots of bad feelings among the losing voters. On such close votes, it is **strongly recommended** that the proposer take steps to address any concerns that were raised and re-submit.
